### Leaflet Challenge

## General Information
In this challenge I used HTML, Javascript, and Leaflet to map earthquake data. I started by creating a for loop and a conditional to store all the data from the GeoJson website which tracks earthquake data. I then Created the Map and added a street layer and then placed circles on it representing an earthquake that happened there in the last 7 days. The circles are different colors to represent the depth of each earthquake (Light blue circles being the closest to the surface and red being the deepest). The size of the circles depended on it magnititude. 

## Technologies used
* HTML
* JavaScript
* Leaflet
* VS code

## Important notes/issues
* I am still working on how to center the map above a certain point
